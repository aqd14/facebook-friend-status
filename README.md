## facebook-photo-gallery
Dynamically layout uploaded/tagged Facebook photos.

### Descriptions
This simple web project use Facebook Graph APIs to authenticate login and get user's photos to display.

### Lesson learned
* JavaScript (basic syntax, callback functions, asynchronous calls)
* Facebook Graph APIs

### Drawbacks & future improvements
* Couldn't figure out how to combine results from multiple async javascript calls.
* Only layout the photos from first page in response. Might implement pagination for all available photos.
* Might provide option to layout photos in an album.
